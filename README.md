# payment
This is a very quick test to show a mockup of a payment form. I have just uploaded the files that are added/modified for this project in a default Laravel installation (Laravel 5.5, I believe). I did not want to put my Stripe info on a public Github repository so I have modified the public and private parts of the stripe token.

I just used the quickest Stripe popup form of their API, as opposed to making a custom form. I would say that the look of the payment form is pretty close to what I was aiming for but the CSS could definitely be tidied up, at the very least. The Laravel/PHP is simple but I used a repository with an interface. The interface could be re-used for a paypal implementation.
